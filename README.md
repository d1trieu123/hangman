# hangman
This is a web application that combines a React tutorial that I followed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj0W8tYX_q8&t=146s with a homework assignment from my Probabilistic Reasoning & Learning course

The homework assignment was to predict the next best possible guess in a hangman game given a corpus of 5 letter words while also giving you the probability that the guess is correct.

I thought itd be cool to implement a front end for this homework assignment and thought itd be a good way to practice my react programming as well!
