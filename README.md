This is a web application that combines a React tutorial that I followed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj0W8tYX_q8&t=146s with a homework assignment from my Probabilistic Reasoning & Learning course

The homework assignment was to predict the next best possible guess in a hangman game given a corpus of 5 letter words while also giving you the probability that the guess is correct.

I thought itd be cool to implement a front end for this homework assignment and thought itd be a good way to practice my react programming as well!

## Gameplay

The game functions just like a normal hangman game but on each guess, it shows the probability that the letter is in the word given its current state of correct and incorrect letters.

On incorrect guess, only the probability of your guess with the option of toggling the next best guess.

On correct guess, the probabilty of both your guess and the best guess would be shown.
